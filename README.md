# Java-Stream-Practice
applying several Stream API functions in a cohesive workflow. Imagine we have a system that processes a list of Employee objects. Our goal is to perform various operations such as filtering, mapping, sorting, and reducing on the employee data.

#Scenario:
We have a list of employees, and we need to:

- Filter employees based on a certain condition 
- Sort the filtered employees by their salary.
- Extract a list of their names.
- Calculate the total salary of the filtered employees.
- Check if all employees meet certain criteria (e.g., all have salaries above a threshold).
